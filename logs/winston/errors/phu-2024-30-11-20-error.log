Sat Nov 30 2024 20:30:51 } [PH] error: Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "debian-openssl-3.0.x".

This happened because Prisma Client was generated for "windows", but the actual deployment required "debian-openssl-3.0.x".
Add "debian-openssl-3.0.x" to `binaryTargets` in the "schema.prisma" file and run `prisma generate` after saving it:

generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
